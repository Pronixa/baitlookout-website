				<p><span class="cursiveFont">Phishing</span> is among the biggest cyber <span class="cursiveFont">threats</span> facing organizations and individuals. One of the most frustrating things about this is that most people know what <span class="cursiveFont">phishing</span> is and how it works, but many still get <span class="cursiveFont">caught out</span>.</p>

				<p><span class="cursiveFont">Phishing</span> still has the same objective – to <span class="cursiveFont">steal</span> our personal data or <span class="cursiveFont">infect</span> our devices – but there are now <span class="cursiveFont">countless</span> ways to do that.</p>
			</div>

 			<div class="slide fade">
				<p>We will look at 5 of the most common types of <span class="cursiveFont">phishing</span> to help you spot the signs of a <span class="cursiveFont">scam</span>.</p>

			<div class="slide fade">
				<p>Email <span class="cursiveFont">phishing</span>
				<br><br>
				Most <span class="cursiveFont">phishing</span> attacks are sent by email. The crook will register a <span class="cursiveFont">fake</span> domain that mimics a genuine organization and sends thousands of generic requests.</p>
				<img src="img/anonymous_left.jpg" alt="Image of an anonymous person">
			</div>

			<div class="slide fade">
				<p>The <span class="cursiveFont">fake</span> domain often involves character substitution, like using ‘r’ and ‘n’ next to each other to create ‘rn’ instead of ‘m’.
				<br><br>
				In other cases, the <span class="cursiveFont">fraudsters</span> create a unique domain that includes the legitimate organization’s name in the URL.</p>
				<img src="img/emailPhishing.jpg" class="emailImg" alt="Image of an email phishing scam">
			</div>

			<div class="slide fade">
				<p>The recipient might see the word "Microsoft" in the sender’s address and assume that it was a genuine email.
				<br><br>
				There are many ways to spot a <span class="cursiveFont">phishing</span> email, but as a general rule, you should always check the email address of a message that asks you to click a link or download an attachment.</p>
				<img src="img/emailPhishing.jpg" class="emailImg" alt="Image of an email phishing scam">
			</div>

			<div class="slide fade">
				<p>Spear <span class="cursiveFont">phishing</span>
				<br><br>
				Spear <span class="cursiveFont">phishing</span> describes <span class="cursiveFont">malicious</span> emails sent to a specific person. <span class="cursiveFont">Criminals</span> who do this will already have some or all of the basic information about the victim.</p>
				<img src="img/anonymous_left.jpg" alt="Image of an anonymous person">
			</div>

			<div class="slide fade">
				<p>You can see in the example how much more convincing spear <span class="cursiveFont">phishing</span> emails are compared to standard <span class="cursiveFont">scams</span>.</p>
				<img src="img/spearPhishing.png" class="spearImg" alt="Image of a spear phishing scam">
			</div>

			<div class="slide fade">
				<p>The <span class="cursiveFont">fraudster</span> has the wherewithal to address the individual by name and (presumably) knows that their job role involves making bank transfers on behalf of the company.
				<br><br>
				The informality of the email also suggests that the sender is a native English speaker, and creates the sense that this is a real message rather than a template.</p>
				<img src="img/spearPhishing.png" class="spearImg" alt="Image of a spear phishing scam">
			</div>

			<div class="slide fade">
				<p>Angler <span class="cursiveFont">phishing</span>
				<br><br>
				A relatively new <span class="cursiveFont">attack</span> vector, social media offers several ways for <span class="cursiveFont">criminals</span> to <span class="cursiveFont">trick</span> people. <span class="cursiveFont">Fake</span> URLs; <span class="cursiveFont">cloned</span> websites, posts, and tweets; and instant messaging can all be used to persuade people to divulge <span class="cursiveFont">sensitive</span> information or download <span class="cursiveFont">malware</span>.</p>
				<img src="img/anonymous_left.jpg"  alt="Image of an anonymous person">
			</div>

			<div class="slide fade">
				<p>Alternatively, <span class="cursiveFont">criminals</span> can use the data that people willingly post on social media to create highly targeted <span class="cursiveFont">attacks</span>.
				<br><br>
				As this example demonstrates, angler <span class="cursiveFont">phishing</span> is often made possible due to the number of people containing organisations directly on social media with complaints.</p>
				<img src="img/anglerPhishing.jpg" class="anglerImg" alt="Image of an angler phishing scam">
			</div>

			<div class="slide fade">
				<p>Organisations often use these as an opportunity to mitigate the <span class="cursiveFont">damage</span> – usually by giving the individual a refund.
				<br><br>
				However, <span class="cursiveFont">scammers</span> are adept at <span class="cursiveFont">hijacking</span> responses and asking the customer to provide their personal details. They are seemingly doing this to facilitate some form of compensation, but it is instead done to <span class="cursiveFont">compromise</span> their accounts.</p>
				<img src="img/anglerPhishing.jpg" class="anglerImg" alt="Image of an angler phishing scam">
			</div>

			<div class="slide fade">
				<p><span class="cursiveFont">Whaling</span>
				<br><br>
				<span class="cursiveFont">Whaling attacks</span> are even more targeted, taking aim at senior executives. Although the end goal of <span class="cursiveFont">whaling</span> is the same as any other kind of <span class="cursiveFont">phishing attack</span>, the technique tends to be a lot subtler.</p>
				<img src="img/anonymous_left.jpg"  alt="Image of an anonymous person">
			</div>

			<div class="slide fade">
				<p>Tricks such as <span class="cursiveFont">fake</span> links and <span class="cursiveFont">malicious</span> URLs aren’t helpful in this instance, as <span class="cursiveFont">criminals</span> are attempting to <span class="cursiveFont">imitate</span> senior staff. 
				<br><br>
				<span class="cursiveFont">Whaling</span> emails also commonly use the pretext of a busy CEO who wants an employee to do them a favour.</p>
				<img src="img/whaling.png" class="whalingImg" alt="Image of a whaling scam">
			</div>

			<div class="slide fade">
				<p>Emails such as this might not be as sophisticated as spear <span class="cursiveFont">phishing</span> emails, but they play on employees’ willingness to follow instructions from their boss. Recipients might <span class="cursiveFont">suspect</span> that something is amiss but are too <span class="cursiveFont">afraid</span> to confront the sender to suggest that they are being unprofessional.</p>
				<img src="img/whaling.png" class="whalingImg" alt="Image of a whaling scam">
			</div>

			<div class="slide fade">
				<p><span class="cursiveFont">Smishing</span> & <span class="cursiveFont">Vishing</span>
				<br><br>
				With both <span class="cursiveFont">smishing</span> and <span class="cursiveFont">vishing</span>, telephones replace emails as the method of communication.
				<br><br>
				<span class="cursiveFont">Smishing</span> involves <span class="cursiveFont">criminals</span> sending text messages (the content of which is much the same as with email <span class="cursiveFont">phishing</span>), and <span class="cursiveFont">vishing involves</span> a telephone conversation.</p>
				<img src="img/anonymous_left.jpg"  alt="Image of an anonymous person">
			</div>

			<div class="slide fade">
				<p>One of the most common <span class="cursiveFont">smishing</span> pretexts are messages supposedly from your bank alerting you to <span class="cursiveFont">suspicious</span> activity.</p>
				<img src="img/smishing.jpg" class="smishingImg" alt="Image of a smishing scam">
			</div>

			<div class="slide fade">
				<p>In this example, the message suggests that you have been the <span class="cursiveFont">victim</span> of <span class="cursiveFont">fraud</span> and tells you to follow a link to prevent further damage.
				<br><br>
				However, the link directs the recipient to a website controlled by the <span class="cursiveFont">fraudster</span> and designed to <span class="cursiveFont">capture</span> your banking details.</p>
				<img src="img/smishing.jpg" class="smishingImg" alt="Image of a smishing scam">
			</div>

			<div class="slide fade">
				<p>Organisations can mitigate the <span class="cursiveFont">risk</span> of <span class="cursiveFont">phishing</span> with technological means, such as spam filters, but these have consistently proven to be <span class="cursiveFont">unreliable</span>.
				<br><br>
				Stay <span class="cursiveFont">vigilant</span>!</p>
